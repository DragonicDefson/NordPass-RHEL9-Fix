# NordPass-RHEL9-Fix
NordPass fix for RHEL9 based Operating Systems (like Rocky 9).

## Additional information
Got a bit tired of the broken NordPass snap package on Rocky 9.1,
so I wrote this Electron wrapper to be able to run NordPass on Rocky 9.1 and other RHEL9 distributions.

# How to build.

Run: ```npm run make``` inside the project directory, the outputted installable binary's will be in out/ after compilation.
